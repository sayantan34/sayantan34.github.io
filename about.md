# Short curriculum vitae

Sayantan Bhattacharya, studied B.Sc Physics at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi , India. He completed his undergraduate degree with first class in 2013. Undergraduate research experience includes working on a project on thermodynamic explanation of friction, under supervision of Dr. S.C Tiwari. Also, attended many conferences and seminars at Indian research institutes. Apart from coursework studies, he took part in many extra-curricular activities within the University.(Member of Academic: A group discussion club, actively co-managed university cultural events.)

Sayantan studied Master of science (MSc) Physics at University Of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India. During this two years course the last year he undertook masters research under the supervision of Dr. Soma Sanyal . His masters project was based on study of inhomogeneity during the big bang nucleaosynthesis process. He presented a thesis titled “Inhomogeneous Big Bang Nucleosynthesis” for completion of MSc. He completed his masters degree in 2018 with first class-distinction. During the summer of 2017 he worked as a summer intern at Bose Institute ,Kolkata, India under the supervision of Dr. Sanjay Ghosh and Dr. Atanu Maulik. His work was based on comparison of different PET solid nuclear track detectors and their use in detecting cosmic rays.This work was published in journal: Radiation Measurements(2018).

Currently he is a PhD student at Department of Physics and Applied physics, University  Of Massachusetts, Lowell since September,2018. He also teaches undergraduate physics courses as a teaching assistant there. He performs his PhD studies on Observational astronomy in the group of Dr. Silas Laycock at LoCCST, Umass Lowell.
