## About

I am a physicist exploring the high-energy universe through X-ray observations,
compact objects, and advanced computational techniques. My research focuses on
understanding extreme astrophysical environments and the physics driving them.

Currently, I am a PhD student in the Department of Physics and Applied Physics
at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, where I also work as a Graduate
Teaching Assistant.
