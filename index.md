 <p> I am a curious stargazer, eager to decipher the mysteries of the universe. Trained as a physicist I find my solace in the heart of nature. I have also keen interest in advanced computational techniques to make astronomy more interesting. 

  Currently I’m a PhD student at Department Of Physics and Applied physics, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA. Also, I enjoy teaching undergraduate courses as a Graduate teaching assistant ,here.

  I’m a member of Dr. Silas Laycock’s astronomy research group at LoCSST, Umass Lowell. Here you can find more information about my background and my research interests, my research projects and my publications.

For more information on any of my interests or me in person, please feel free to contact me ! </p>
