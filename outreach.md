I'm one of the astronomers at Richard Schueller Observatory, Umass Lowell. We organize regular public observing nights accompanied by public talks on various topics. We also organize different public activity nights like a Summer stargazing guide, BYOT (Bring your own telescope), Spooky Starry Night (Halloween), etc.

We at Umass Lowell organize Science & Technology (STEM) fairs for school students ranging from primary to high schools. The astronomy department holds exhibitions showcasing exciting science experiments and engaging student activities.

# Talks & Teachs 

I recently gave a virtual talk on Career opportunities in Physics and Astronomy at a youtube channel: EduCanteen. Link for the video. 

Taught a course in LIRA, Umass Lowell (Spring 2023) to retired folks of various backgrounds. It was a great experience, looking forward to many more such opportunities.
