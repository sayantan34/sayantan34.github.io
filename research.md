## X-ray Binary Systems

I study variability and timing behavior in X-ray binary systems to understand
accretion processes onto compact objects. Using archival observational data,
I analyze light curves and power spectra to characterize physical mechanisms
driving high-energy emission.

**Methods**
- Timing analysis
- Fourier power spectra
- Archival X-ray observations

## Massive Stars and High-Energy Emission

My research investigates massive stellar systems and their high-energy radiation
environments. I use observational datasets to explore stellar winds, feedback,
and variability in extreme astrophysical environments.

**Methods**
- Spectral analysis
- Multi-wavelength observations
- Data modeling

## Computational Analysis

I apply computational techniques to astrophysical datasets, including data
processing, statistical analysis, and automation of observational pipelines.

**Methods**
- Python data analysis
- Numerical modeling
- Automated pipelines
